# This is a placeholder for the music file
# In a real implementation, you would need to:
# 1. Download the actual music file from the YouTube video
# 2. Ensure you have proper licensing rights to use the music
# 3. Convert it to MP3 format if needed
# 4. Place it in this public/music/ directory

# For now, this serves as a placeholder to prevent 404 errors
# The music functionality will work once you add the actual music file
